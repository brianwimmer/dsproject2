# dsproject2 - Brian Wimmer
GitHub repository for the final project of DS3002. For this project, I decided to complete option 1 - Data Ingestion & Analysis.

To begin the project, I created a directory within my terminal titled 'dsproject24'. I then gathered the API from the URL (https://4feaquhyai.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/api/pi). Within the terminal, I created a virtual environment to ensure pip installs correctly. I then opened the created app.py and formulated my code. This code included attaching the host created within AWS Lambda when i made the RDS instance. I also created a host username and password to connect with mysql via Workbench. Next, I connected to the database using phpmyadmin to create column names and ensure data connectivity. Within my code, I set the cursor to include these same column names (factor, pi, time) with space for the values to be fed into via the API. I created a function that would pull those values from the API and then fed into the database (phpmyadmin). Finally, I set a scheddule to ensure the API is ran once per minute for an hour.
